# 🧪 Testing Documentation - Library Management System

This document provides comprehensive information about the testing suite for the Library Management System.

## 📋 Test Overview

The testing suite consists of two main categories:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components and classes in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test complete workflows and user scenarios

## 🏗️ Test Structure

```

## 🛠️ Adding New Tests

### Unit Test Template

```python
class TestNewFeature(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures"""
        pass

    def test_feature_functionality(self):
        """Test the new feature"""
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert
        pass
```

### Integration Test Template

```python
def test_new_workflow(self):
    """Test complete workflow for new feature"""
    # Setup
    # Execute workflow
    # Verify results
    pass
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**

    - Ensure you're running from the project root directory
    - Check that all files are in the correct locations

2. **Test Failures**

    - Review the specific test output for details
    - Check that the core functionality hasn't been modified
    - Verify that all dependencies are available

3. **Performance Issues**
    - Tests should complete within 5 seconds
    - If slower, check for infinite loops or inefficient operations

## 📚 Best Practices

### Test Design

-   Each test should be independent
-   Use descriptive test method names
-   Include both positive and negative test cases
-   Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Maintenance

-   Update tests when adding new features
-   Ensure tests reflect current functionality
-   Keep test data realistic and relevant
-   Document any test-specific requirements
